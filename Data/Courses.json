    "description": "Using design patterns can be extremely helpful, mostly because they save time (money) and get us better results, faster. Which is the core philosophy of agile application development. As designers, we can leverage these patterns and use them in our daily design decision-making because these patterns and components are used every day across many user experiences and users have been accustomed to how these patterns work. These patterns are less risky than designing something from scratch or creating a brand new user interface. We donâ€™t need to apply them exactly as they are to every problem we encounter, but rather we can build on top of them, using our experience to inform our decisions because we know that these patterns work.",
